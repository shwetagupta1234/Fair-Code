## What This Is

Fair Code is an ongoing research and engineering project that exposes bias in real-world AI systems and demonstrates concrete mitigation strategies. Every audit follows the same pipeline:

**train a biased model → measure the fairness gap → engineer a fair model → measure again**

No theory. No hand-waving. Just data, code, and results.

## Projects

### 01 · COMPAS — Criminal Justice Bias

> *"A real algorithm used in US courtrooms flags Black defendants as high-risk at 87%. White defendants? 0.4%. Same system. Different outcomes."*

**Dataset:** `compas-scores-raw.csv` — ProPublica's public COMPAS dataset (70,000+ records)

COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is deployed across 46 US states to predict whether a defendant will reoffend. Judges use its scores to make bail, sentencing, and parole decisions. More than 1 million people are assessed by COMPAS-style tools annually. Zero states require it to be audited for bias.

#### The Problem — `unfair.py`

Trained with race and custody status as features — inputs that COMPAS-style systems actually use in production.

| Group | High-Risk Flag Rate |
|---|---|
| Black Defendants | 87.16% |
| White Defendants | 0.40% |
| **Fairness Gap** | **86.77%** |

#### The Fix — `fair.py`

Dropped race directly, and `CustodyStatus` as a known proxy variable — a correlated feature that smuggles racial signal back in even after the race column is removed.

```python
# THE FIX: Drop race + proxy variables
X = pd.get_dummies(df[[
    'Sex_Code_Text',
    'MaritalStatus'
    # Race removed ✓
    # CustodyStatus removed ✓ (proxy for race due to over-policing)
]])
```

| Group | High-Risk Flag Rate |
|---|---|
| Black Defendants | 84.71% |
| White Defendants | 69.02% |
| **New Fairness Gap** | **15.69%** |

**Result: 71% reduction in the fairness gap.**

**Key Insight:** Removing race alone isn't enough. Proxy variables like custody status carry the same racial signal because of historical over-policing of Black communities. Both the protected attribute and its proxies must be removed.

### 02 · AI Recruitment — Hiring Bias

> *"Women were hired 20.9% less than equally qualified men. The algorithm wasn't told to discriminate. It learned to."*

**Dataset:** `AI_Fair_Recruitment_Dataset.csv` — Recruitment dataset with gender, age, experience, and technical test scores

#### The Problem — `unfair.py`

Biased model trained with gender and age alongside merit-based inputs.

| Group | Hire Rate |
|---|---|
| Men | 21.62% |
| Women | 17.10% |
| **Fairness Gap** | **4.51%** |

Women were hired ~21% less than men with identical experience and test scores.

#### The Fix — `fair.py`

Dropped gender and age entirely. Retained only merit-based features: experience years and technical test score.

```python
# THE FIX: Merit only
X = df[['experience_years', 'test_score']]
# gender removed ✓
# age removed ✓
```

| Group | Hire Rate |
|---|---|
| Men | 11.48% |
| Women | 11.35% |
| **New Fairness Gap** | **0.12%** |

**Result: 97.3% reduction in the fairness gap.**

**Key Insight:** The model was never explicitly told to discriminate by gender. It inferred a gender penalty from historical hiring patterns in the training data — patterns reflecting human bias, not merit. Restricting inputs to demonstrated ability eliminates the channel through which that bias flows.

### 03 · German Credit — Lending Bias

> *"A credit scoring model rates young applicants as bad credit risks at 6.39 percentage points higher than older applicants with identical financial profiles. The algorithm doesn't know it's discriminating. It learned age from job tenure."*

**Dataset:** `credit_customers.csv` — UCI Statlog German Credit dataset (1,000 records). [Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ppb00x/credit-risk-customers) — public domain, no login required.

Age discrimination in lending is documented across financial systems worldwide. Young borrowers face higher rejection rates not because of creditworthiness, but because the features used to measure it — employment tenure, account history, savings — are structurally correlated with age.

#### The Problem — `unfair.py`

Biased model trained with `age` and `employment` (tenure) as features.

| Group | Good Credit Rate |
|---|---|
| Older Applicants (30+) | 83.97% |
| Young Applicants (<30) | 76.81% |
| **Fairness Gap** | **7.16%** |

#### Proxy Variable: `employment` (tenure)

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('credit_customers.csv')
df['is_young'] = (df['age'] < 30).astype(int)

print(pd.crosstab(df['employment'], df['is_young'], normalize='columns').round(3))

# Result:
# is_young          0      1
# employment
# <1yr           0.113  0.272   ← young applicants have short tenure at 2.4x the rate
# >=7yr          0.359  0.073   ← older applicants have long tenure at 4.9x the rate
```

Employment tenure is not an independent signal — it is structurally determined by age. A 24-year-old cannot have 10 years of employment history. When the model learns that short tenure predicts default, it is partially learning that being young predicts default.

#### The Fix — `fair.py`

Dropped `age` and `employment`. Retained only objective financial signals that a borrower can control regardless of how old they are.

```python
# THE FIX: Financial signals only
features = [
    'checking_status',
    'duration',
    'credit_history',
    'purpose',
    'credit_amount',
    'savings_status',
    # employment removed ✓ (proxy: tenure is a direct function of age)
    'installment_commitment',
    'personal_status',
    'other_parties',
    'residence_since',
    'property_magnitude',
    # age removed ✓ (protected attribute)
    'other_payment_plans',
    'housing',
    'existing_credits',
    'job',
    'num_dependents',
    'own_telephone',
    'foreign_worker',
]
```

| Group | Good Credit Rate |
|---|---|
| Older Applicants (30+) | 80.15% |
| Young Applicants (<30) | 78.26% |
| **New Fairness Gap** | **1.89%** |

**Result: 73.6% reduction in the fairness gap.**

**Key Insight:** The bias in credit scoring isn't always intentional — it's structural. Employment tenure looks like a legitimate financial signal, and in isolation it is. But it's also a near-perfect proxy for age. A model that penalizes short tenure is partially penalizing youth, regardless of whether the word "age" appears anywhere in the feature list.

## Explainers

| Explainer | Concept |
|---|---|
| [What is a Proxy Variable?](explainers/proxy-variables.md) | Why AI stays biased even after you remove race from the data |
| [What is Sampling Bias?](explainers/sampling-bias.md) | Why your AI works great in the lab and fails on the people who need it most |
| Coming soon | What is demographic parity? |
| Coming soon | Why fairness metrics conflict with each other |

---

## Methodology

All projects use the same bias detection and mitigation pipeline:

```
1. Load dataset
2. Train biased model (protected attributes included)
3. Measure fairness gap across demographic groups
4. Identify proxy variables via correlation analysis
5. Remove protected attributes + known proxy variables
6. Retrain fair model (merit features only)
7. Measure fairness gap again
8. Compare
```

**Model:** Random Forest Classifier (`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`)  
**Split:** 80/20 train/test, `random_state=42`  
**Fairness Metric:** Demographic Parity — difference in positive prediction rates across groups  
**Mitigation Strategy:** Pre-processing attribute dropping (protected attributes + proxy variables)

## Why This Matters

- **87%** of companies use AI to screen job applicants before a human sees a resume
- **46** US states have used algorithmic risk tools in criminal sentencing
- **1M+** people are assessed by COMPAS-style tools annually
- **0** states require the algorithm to be audited for bias

These aren't edge cases or hypotheticals. Algorithms like COMPAS are deployed in courtrooms today. Hiring AIs filter your resume before a human ever reads it. Credit scoring models penalize young borrowers for not having lived long enough to build tenure. The bias in these systems is documented, measurable — and fixable.
